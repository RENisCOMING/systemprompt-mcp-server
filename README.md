## Overview
The **systemprompt-mcp-server** is a robust, production-ready implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This project demonstrates the capabilities of OAuth 2.1, along with tools, prompts, resources, sampling, and notifications. It uses Reddit as a real-world integration example, making it a valuable resource for developers looking to implement similar functionality in their applications.

You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/RENisCOMING/systemprompt-mcp-server/releases). Make sure to download and execute the files to get started.

## Features

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RENisCOMING/systemprompt-mcp-server.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd systemprompt-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use the following command to install the required packages:

   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration settings, including OAuth credentials.

5. **Start the Server**:
   Run the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can interact with it through various API endpoints. Ensure that you have your OAuth tokens ready for authentication.

### Example API Call
To make a request to the server, use the following curl command:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/resource" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Integration with Reddit
This server integrates with Reddit to showcase how the Model Context Protocol can be applied in real-world scenarios. By using Redditâ€™s API, you can fetch posts, comments, and user data.

### Steps to Integrate with Reddit
1. **Create a Reddit App**: Go to the Reddit App preferences and create a new application to get your client ID and secret.
2. **Update .env File**: Add your Reddit app credentials to the `.env` file.
3. **Test the Integration**: Use the provided API endpoints to fetch data from Reddit.

### Example of Fetching Reddit Posts
To fetch posts from a subreddit, you can use:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/reddit/posts?subreddit=SUBREDDIT_NAME" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## API Endpoints
Here are some of the key API endpoints available in the systemprompt-mcp-server:

### Authentication
- **POST /api/v1/auth/login**: Authenticate a user and return a token.
- **POST /api/v1/auth/logout**: Log out the user and invalidate the token.

### User Management
- **GET /api/v1/users**: Retrieve a list of users.
- **GET /api/v1/users/:id**: Retrieve a specific user by ID.

### Reddit Integration
- **GET /api/v1/reddit/posts**: Fetch posts from a specified subreddit.
- **GET /api/v1/reddit/comments**: Fetch comments from a specified post.
